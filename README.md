# PDF DIFF

A local drawing-comparison and electrical coordination app. PDFs and annotations are processed in the browser; nothing is uploaded. Fonts, PDF rendering workers, and dependencies are bundled locally.

## Open the app

Double-click **Start-PDF-DIFF.cmd**, or run `npm start`, then open http://127.0.0.1:4321. Keep the server window open. The app requires Node.js 20.15 or newer; dependencies and the production build are already present in this workspace. If the preview is already running on port 4321, simply open that URL.

For a fresh checkout: `npm ci`, then `npm run build` and `npm start`.

For development: `npm run dev`. Validate with `npm test` and `npm run build`.

## Drawing review

1. The app initially opens a clearly marked, two-sheet sample project. Its first sheet includes unreviewed sample clouds generated from the actual PDF differences.
2. Click **Original** and **Revised** to open your PDFs. Pages are paired by index. Replacing the revised file asks before clearing existing annotations.
3. Compare in **Overlay**, **Split**, or **Revised** view. Blue ink is added; red ink is removed. Use sensitivity and blending under **Settings**. Different page proportions disable automatic comparison.
4. Click **Auto-cloud changes**, or choose **Revcloud** and drag a rectangle. Select a cloud to edit its label, note and review status. In Select mode, drag a markup to reposition it. Undo reverses annotation edits. Auto-cloud processes the currently selected page only.
5. In **Electrical**, choose a device and click the drawing to place markers. Edit circuit and VA for each marker. Counts are per sheet; circuit summaries aggregate the loaded drawing set. VA defaults are editable placeholders, not code-prescribed values.
6. **Export review** creates either an all-sheet reviewed PDF or a CSV register containing every annotation. The reviewed PDF is a raster copy with flattened markups, not editable PDF annotations. Detailed review notes and circuit data are included in CSV/JSON; the PDF shows cloud labels, note labels and device symbols.
7. **Save review** downloads editable markups as JSON. Keep it with the PDFs. Use the folder icon beside Drawing set to load it. The revised PDF's SHA-256 fingerprint must match, even if the filename is the same. The original PDF need not be present to restore revised-sheet markups.

Shortcuts: **V** select, **C** cloud, **D** device, **N** note, **Ctrl+Z** undo, **Escape** select. Zoom and fit controls are in the drawing toolbar. A sheet selector remains available below the drawing on smaller screens.

## Practical limits

- Visual pixel comparison only; no OCR, electrical symbol recognition, automatic alignment, sheet-number matching or electrical-code certification.
- Matching orientation, scale and registration give the best result. Scans, translation and inconsistent exports can create false-positive regions. Review every suggested cloud.
- Render comparison at 1,400 pixels wide; exports at 2,200 pixels wide. Large-format drawing detail is therefore limited in the raster export. Original PDFs are never modified.
- Electrical calculations use entered apparent power: `I = VA / V`, or `VA / (sqrt(3) * V)` for balanced three-phase loads. No demand, diversity, continuous-load, breaker, ampacity, voltage-drop or fault-current calculation is implied.
- Password-protected PDFs must be unlocked before loading. File picker accepts up to 150 MB; browser memory is the practical limit for large drawing sets.
- Work lives in memory. Save a review before refreshing or closing. Review JSON contains labels and notes, not the source PDFs. Nothing is published.

## Implementation

- `src/app.js`: review state, UI, tools, page pairing and local import/export.
- `src/core.js`: pure pixel difference, cloud geometry, CSV safety and load arithmetic.
- `src/pdf.js`: PDF.js rendering, file fingerprinting and pdf-lib raster export.
- `src/demo.js`: deterministic sample PDFs, marked not for construction.
- `tests/`: focused algorithms and sample-PDF checks.
